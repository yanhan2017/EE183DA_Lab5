Our trajectory planning simulation takes in the dimention of the arena, start point, end point and obstacles. It first plans out a path for the robot, then use Extended Kalman Filter to estimate the current position of the robot as it follows the path. When the computation ends, it plots out both the planned trajectory and the actual trajectory as in the figure path.png.
